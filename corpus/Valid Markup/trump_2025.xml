                dealers, gang members, and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were

                realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them
                stand or smile or applaud. Nothing I can do. I could find a cure to the most
                devastating disease—a disease that would wipe out entire nations—or announce the
                answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime to the lowest
                levels ever recorded, and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not

                trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying. I withdrew from the

                I have directed that for every 1 new regulation, 10 old regulations must be
                eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term. And in that first
                term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other
                President had done before.</policy>
        </p>
        <p>
            <policy type="d" connotation="positive" when="present" value="eco">We ordered all Federal

        </p>
        <p>
            <policy type="d" connotation="positive" when="present" value="pa">And we have ended
                weaponized Government, where, as an example, a sitting President is allowed to
