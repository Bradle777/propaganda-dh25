                by many that the first month of our Presidency—it's our Presidency—is the most
                successful in the history of our nation—by many. And what makes it even more
                impressive is that—do you know who number two is? George Washington. How about that?
                    <audience noise="other">[laughter]</audience> How about that? I don't know about

                dealers, gang members, and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were

                realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them
                stand or smile or applaud. Nothing I can do. I could find a cure to the most
                devastating disease—a disease that would wipe out entire nations—or announce the
                answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime to the lowest
                levels ever recorded, and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not
                stand, and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't

                this 1 night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America?

                scam." I withdrew from the unfair Paris climate accord, which was costing us
                trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying. I withdrew from the

            <policy type="d" connotation="positive" when="present" value="eco">To unshackle our economy,
                I have directed that for every 1 new regulation, 10 old regulations must be
                eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term. And in that first
                term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other
                President had done before.</policy>
        </p>
        <p>
            <policy type="d" connotation="positive" when="present" value="eco">We ordered all Federal
                workers to return to the office. They will either show up for work in person or be

        </p>
        <p>
            <policy type="d" connotation="positive" when="present" value="pa">And we have ended
                weaponized Government, where, as an example, a sitting President is allowed to
