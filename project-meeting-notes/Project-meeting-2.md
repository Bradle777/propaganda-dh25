# Project Meeting 2
<P> Tiberio brought up an AI approach of distance markup based on what he started with. 
Gave idea to do initial reading of the hand selected documents, and input those into an AI
engine and tell the AI to follow our approach for all the un marked up documents.

For next week, we want our hand done markup to be finished so we cna discuss strategies and markup that worked
and anything we want to add. We will then create a schema to validate our hand markup, and once the files are
validated, we can apply the AI approach to the rest of the files.
