# Project Meeting 4

### Completed Markup
<li>Biden 2023
<li>Biden 2024
<li>Trump 2021
<li>Obama 2015 - Luis will validate this week
<li>Obama 2011 - Luis will validate this week
<li>Trump 2017 - Luis will validate this week

### Addressing Research Questions

<p>Can quantify what issues are addressed and what issues are not adddressed.
Possible add-on: Creating a timeline on the website that includes major events
that are brought up in the state of the Unions. 

<p>One issue with our markup is that it does not specify whether a president is lying
or not, but we know, and so we have included comments. We won't be able to quantify it
so it will be important to have a section that includes our thoughts on how often a president
lied and the means of which they did it.

### For Next Week
Meet in recitation for next week instead of on Friday.
Luis will continue to validate xml against the schema, and 
will produce an xslt transformation to put the basic text into html form.
Tiberio will upgrade the website with CSS styling and extra html organization.
Every member should add information to the little bio section on the homepage too.
