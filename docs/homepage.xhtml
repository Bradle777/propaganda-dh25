            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>We aim to analyse what have been different American Presidents' approaches to propaganda, and how those strategy changes unfolded over time. <br/>
                We are defining <b>propaganda</b> as a <i>message to reinforce or change others political beliefs.</i> </p>
            <h2>Corpus</h2>
            <p>We analyze the annual State of The Union Adress given by the President. Our corpus spans the years <b>1982 to 2025.</b></p> 
            <h2>Research Questions</h2>
            <ul class="nobullets"><li>How has the discourse on different topics evolved with context to importance and how have they been prioritized by different parties and presidents?</li>
                <li>How have different presidents conveyed messages and how has congress responded?</li>
                <li>Does speech length relate to the address of many issues or an in-depth focus on one issue?</li>
                <li>How has the amount of time spent focused on a hot topic changed over the years?</li>
            </ul>
